# Bidir DeepReverse Engineering(Open Source Project)
> Implemented Deep Learning to the extracted string from the malicious url
  1.Sequence to Sequence text classification
  2.Extracted the Byte Code and Converted to strings( aka X variable)
  3.Each row is encoding with GLove(dimension of 300x83)
  4.train the model with Bi-direction LSTM and GRU as well.

> ToDo's
  1.Hybrid Architecture
  2.Tune the features space
