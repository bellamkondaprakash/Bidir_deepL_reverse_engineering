# Bidir DeepReverse Engineering(Open Source Project)
> Implemented Deep Learning to the extracted string from the malicious url
  * Sequence to Sequence text classification
  * Extracted the Byte Code and Converted to strings( aka X variable)
  * Each row is encoding with GLove(dimension of 300x83)
  * train the model with Bi-direction LSTM and GRU as well.

> ToDo's
  * Hybrid Architecture
  * Tune the features space
